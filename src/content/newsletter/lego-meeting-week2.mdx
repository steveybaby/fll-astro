Hi LEGO League Parents,

I hope this message finds you well\! We had a fantastic kickoff during our last meetings:
* [Sunday session](/meetings/2025-08-17-challenge-review/)
* [Wednesday practice](/meetings/2025-08-20-team-meeting/)

Click on the meeting links above to review our progress, see photos and even the python code that the team wrote! The kids have now reviewed our **[13 missions](https://youtu.be/ErDj8myI_Tg)** and started learning some Python coding skills!

Here are some highlights:

### **1.Team Information**

* **Team Name:** Looting Llamas
* **Slogan:** *Looting Tombs since 2024\!*
* **Team Spirit Ideas:** T-shirts with our rainbow-colored logo (designed by Luca) and a team flag to showcase at the tournament.
* **Logo Display:** The team want to build a large LEGO llama for our Innovation Project display table.

### **2\. Practice Schedule**
To simplify everyone’s busy weekday schedules, we’ll focus on one longer weekly practice:

* **Sundays, 3:30–6:00 PM**

### **3\. Snacks**
Parents will take turns providing light snacks (crackers, fruit, energy bars, apples, etc.) for Sunday practices. Click **[for the snack sign-up sheet](/snacks)** and sign up for any gap sessions\!

### **4\. Expertise Needed**

This year’s theme is “Unearthed.” For our Innovation Project, we’d love to connect with an archaeologist, historian, or another expert in a related field who can share insights with the kids.
