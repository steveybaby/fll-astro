# Post-Interview Debrief

## Meeting Summary

The group discussed the destructive nature of archaeological digging, emphasizing the trade-off between excavation and preservation. They explored ideas such as using landfill to restore dig sites and employing AI technology to scan for artifacts without excavation. The conversation included homework to research existing underground scanning technologies and plans for an upcoming field trip.

### Key Points

- Excavation destroys archaeological sites, risking loss of artifacts and historical context
- Proposed solutions include filling holes with landfill to restore sites and developing better digging methods
- AI scanning technology, similar to medical imaging, could detect artifacts underground without digging
- Existing technologies like metal detectors were discussed as partial solutions, but limitations remain for non-metal artifacts
- Homework assigned to research current underground scanning technologies and potential AI applications

### Open Questions for Further Research

- How can AI accurately detect and identify various types of artifacts underground?
- What existing technologies beyond metal detectors can scan underground effectively?
- How to balance excavation needs with site preservation in practical terms?

## Action Items

- Students to research technologies for scanning underground artifacts
- Parents to provide availability for the upcoming field trip on Saturday
- Steve Harper to create a webpage/calendar for scheduling and information sharing

## Homework Assignment

**Research Topic:** How can archaeologists use new technologiesâ€”such as AI and advanced non-invasive scanning tools that create underground imagesâ€”to study and uncover important artifacts, while deciding what should be excavated and what should remain preserved for future generations with better tools?

Students should research and prepare to discuss this topic at next Sunday's meeting (September 28th).
