# Sunday Workshop

## Meeting Summary

The team got together for an extended work session focused on multiple aspects of our FLL challenge preparation.

## Robot Missions

We successfully figured out a couple more missions and continued refining our robot programming strategies.

## Innovation Project

A major highlight of today's meeting was our work on the innovation project. After careful consideration and discussion, the team selected **"Virtual Reality Museum"** as our innovative solution to address the storage predicament challenge. This exciting concept will allow us to explore how virtual reality technology can help preserve and make accessible historical artifacts and collections that face storage limitations.
