- Do archaeologists use robots? How do you see robots being used in the future?
- What are the tradeoffs of mechanical vs. manual excavation?
- What are potential pros & cons in the use of automation (and/or high tech)?
- Are the more expensive technologies funded or worth it?

### Future of Archaeology
- Do you think that archaeologists will seek different things in the future than they do in the present?
- What will the education of future archeologists require?
- Does archaeology help science with new discoveries, or vice versa?
- Do you think at some point in the future, we'll find all the artifacts?
- What would you change about archeology?

### Industry & Economics
