# Archaeologist Interview Session

## Meeting Overview
Special interview session with a professional archaeologist to support our Innovation Project research and development.

**ðŸ“… When:** Wednesday, September 17, 2025 at 2:30-3:30 PM  
**ðŸ’» Join:** [Zoom: https://veeva.zoom.us/j/4888725453?pwd=Nm1VYS9xdTNKUlY3MnZZZ1Z4WUJ1dz09](https://veeva.zoom.us/j/4888725453?pwd=Nm1VYS9xdTNKUlY3MnZZZ1Z4WUJ1dz09)

## Interview Questions

### Introduction (Jasper: a, Asher: b & c)
- Introduce herself
- What do you do?
- Why did you want to become an archaeologist?
- Describe your perspective of archeology?

### Challenges & Benefits (Jeremiah: a & b, Luca: c)
- What are the challenges for you? In your job?
- Across the field of archeology?
- What are the benefits for society?

### Tools (Ethan: a & b, Kai: c)
- What are the tools that you use in your job?
- What tasks do humans do now that could change in the future? Maybe with mechanical equipment for excavation sensing equipment, e.g. lidar, or AI for identification?
- How do you track where the artifacts are?

### Summary (Kai: a, Jasper: b)
- Do you think at some point in the future, we'll find all the artifacts?
- What would you change about archeology?

### Additional Questions
- What is something that you find interesting about archaeology that most people don't know?
- What type of person becomes an archeologist? How?
- How is your work funded vs. privately funded projects?

## Meeting Goals
- Gather expert insights for our Innovation Project
- Understand real-world challenges in archaeology
- Explore technology opportunities in the field
- Document findings for project presentation

## Meeting Notes

### Interview Summary

Dr. Jones protects and studies archaeological sites at the Presidio, a national park with historical significance dating back to 1776.

**Key Points:**
- Archaeology reveals untold stories of diverse groups often excluded from history, benefiting society by making history more inclusive
- Major challenges include the "curation crisis," managing vast artifact collections, and preserving sites without destructive digging
- Tools range from simple shovels and trowels to digital technologies such as 3D modeling and remote sensing like LIDAR
- AI could assist in interpreting scan data, organizing artifact collections, and reducing excavation impact by identifying artifact locations non-invasively

### Key Challenges Discussed

**1. Managing Artifacts â€“ The Curation Crisis**
- The biggest challenge is the sheer volume of artifacts that come out of the ground
- Every item has to be analyzed, cataloged, stored, and cared for "in perpetuity" (forever)
- Her lab, built in 2010, is already almost full because of how much material is unearthed
- Archaeologists must constantly decide what is worth keeping versus what can be let go, which is very difficult

**2. Preservation vs. Excavation**
- Digging itself is destructiveâ€”once you excavate, the site is gone and you can't put it back
- She stressed that archaeologists of the future will have better tools, so ideally today's sites should be preserved for them
- This creates tension between wanting to uncover information now and wanting to leave sites untouched for future generations

**3. Protecting Artifacts Long-Term**
- Artifacts are fragile and require controlled environments (humidity, pests, climate control) to survive
- They need constant monitoring, which consumes time, space, and funding
- She noted that even something as small as pest infestations can threaten entire collections

**4. Field-Wide Challenge: The Curation Crisis**
- Beyond her own work, the whole field of archaeology faces this challenge
- Globally, museums and labs are overwhelmed by the volume of excavated material that requires indefinite storage and care

### Student Ideas Discussed

**1. AI-Powered Scanning & Pattern Recognition**
- Student idea: A scanner (like ground-penetrating radar or LIDAR) paired with AI that could detect artifacts underground by analyzing differences in soil patterns, density, or materials
- Dr. Jones' response:
  - She confirmed scanning tech exists but interpreting the patterns is trickyâ€”like seeing shapes in clouds
  - AI could be powerful because it can compare scans against large datasets and recognize consistent patterns that humans might miss
  - This would reduce destructive digging and help archaeologists focus on the most promising sites

**2. Smarter Preservation with AI & Sensors**
- Student idea: Use AI and sensors in storage facilities to monitor artifacts automatically (e.g., detect pests, humidity shifts, or structural damage)
- Dr. Jones' response:
  - She said this would directly address the "curation crisis"
  - Automation could help safeguard artifacts "in perpetuity" without relying solely on human monitoring
  - It would lighten the burden on staff and ensure fragile items get early protection if something goes wrong

**3. Automated Cataloging & Counting**
- Student idea: AI systems that could automatically catalog, label, or even count artifacts as they come in (instead of interns spending weeks counting thousands of tiny fragments)
- Dr. Jones' response:
  - She was enthusiastic, noting that even simple automation could save huge amounts of time
  - For example, one intern had to count 10,000 tiny metal fragments by hand; AI-powered counting could eliminate this kind of repetitive labor
  - This would free archaeologists to focus on interpretation rather than data entry

**4. Public Engagement Tools**
- Student idea: Fifth graders could help make archaeology more relatable by creating projects that explain archaeology in ways other kids could understand
- Dr. Jones' response:
  - She emphasized this is hugely valuable
  - Younger audiences are often better at translating archaeology into accessible stories for peers
  - She encouraged students to think of awareness projects (e.g., games, videos, exhibits) as part of their innovation work

### Open Questions for Further Research
- How can AI be further developed to improve artifact detection and cataloging without excavation?
- What are the best ways to engage the public, especially children, in appreciating and supporting archaeology?
- How will future archaeologists improve upon current excavation and preservation methods?

## Next Steps

### Action Items
- Brainstorm potential technological solutions with the team to aid archaeology, especially non-invasive scanning and AI applications, and share ideas with Dr. Jones for feedback
- Plan participation in the Presidio archaeology lab open house on September 27th to enhance understanding and inspire project ideas
- Continue developing our Innovation Project based on insights from today's interview
