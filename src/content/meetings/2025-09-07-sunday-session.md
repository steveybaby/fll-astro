## Meeting Agenda

### Innovation Project: Archeologist Interview
- What is the most challenging part of archaeology?  Is it getting funding?  
- What types of activities do you do at a dig site?  And in preparation for a dig project?
- What type of standards do you follow at a dig site?
- How could Artificial Intelligence be used to help archaeologists?   Or support the business of Archeology?
- Do archaeologists use robots?  How do you see robots being used in the future?
- What are the tradeoffs of mechanical vs. manual excavation?
- What are potential pros & cons in the use of automation (and/or high tech)?
- Do you think that archaeologists will seek different things in the future than they do in the present?
- What does the free market most value in terms of archifacts?
- How does the competing interest of the mining industry challenge archaeology?  
- How does excavation profit (mining?) negatively impact archeology?  How often are completing interests challenges?
- How might archaeology be self-funded?  Opportunities for commercialization of discoveries, limited edition replicas?
- Are the more expensive technologies funded or worth it?
-  What will the education of future archeologists require?
- Does archaeology help science with new discoveries, or vice versa?
- Do you think at some point in the future, we'll find all the artifacts?
- What would you change about archeology?
