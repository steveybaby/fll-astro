## Meeting Notes

All team members and coaches were present for today's session.

We spent most of the meeting building attachments and coding. The team made good progress on both mechanical and programming aspects of the robot.

We verified that we can still achieve our 120-point target with the current robot configuration and mission strategies.

Asher successfully added a new challenge completion to our mission mix, expanding our scoring potential.

We are now up to 160 points!
