# Sunday Session
*NOTE: This meeting will be at Steve Schimmels house in Oakland*

## Meeting Highlights
The kids used ChatGPT to narrow down their Innovation Project topic to something that matches both their grade level and interests.
Luca will continue refining our team logo.
The kids also brainstormed questions for our upcoming interview with an archaeologist (date TBA).
Here's a new Llama logo from chatGPT!
